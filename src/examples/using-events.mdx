# Examples with Events

import {Fragment, useState} from 'react'
import { Playground, PropsTable } from 'docz'
import ReactSlidy from '../index.js'
import Number from '../examples/Number'
import '../index.scss'

You could use `doBeforeSlide`, `doAfterSlide` and `doAfterDestroy` events to execute callbacks when some events are ocurring with the slider.

## doBeforeSlide

Callback that will be executed BEFORE the slide transition has been completed.

<Playground>
  <ReactSlidy doBeforeSlide={({currentSlide, nextSlide}) => alert(`The next slide is the number ${nextSlide} and the current is ${currentSlide}`)}>
    <Number num={1} />
    <Number num={2} />
    <Number num={3} />
    <Number num={4} />
  </ReactSlidy>
</Playground>

## doAfterSlide

Callback that will be executed AFTER the slide transition has been completed.

<Playground>
  <ReactSlidy doAfterSlide={({currentSlide}) => alert(`The next slide is the number ${currentSlide}`)}>
    <Number num={1} />
    <Number num={2} />
    <Number num={3} />
    <Number num={4} />
  </ReactSlidy>
</Playground>

## doAfterDestroy

Do you need to perform some clean up? You could use the `doAfterDestroy` callback that will be executed AFTER the slider is destroyed.

<Playground>
    {() => {
    const [render, setRender] = useState(true)
    
    return (
      <Fragment>
        <button onClick={() => setRender(!render)}>
          { render ? 'Destroy slider!' : 'Show slider!' }
        </button>
        {
          render && <ReactSlidy doAfterDestroy={() => alert('slider destroyed!')}>
          <Number num={1} />
          <Number num={2} />
          <Number num={3} />
          <Number num={4} />
        </ReactSlidy>
        }
      </Fragment>
    )
  }}
</Playground>
